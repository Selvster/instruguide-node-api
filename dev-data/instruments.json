    "description": "A CMM is a device for measuring the physical geometrical characteristics of an object. It can be operated manually or controlled via computer. A CMM is equipped with a probe, which touches the object's surface. The probe may be mechanical, optical, laser, or white light. The probe's movement is recorded by the CMM's computer and can be used to measure the object's geometry.",
